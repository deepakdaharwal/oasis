             <p>
                
                Milkha Singh was born on 20 November 1929 
                into a Rathore Rajput Sikh family. His birthplace was Govindpura, 
                a village 10 kilometres from Muzaffargarh city in Punjab 
                Province, British India (now Muzaffargarh District, Pakistan).<br><br>
                Singh represented India in the 200m and 400m competitions of the 1956 
                Melbourne Olympic Games.In 1958, Singh set records for the 200m and 400m 
                in the National Games of India, held at Cuttack.<br><br>He was one of 15 siblings, 
                eight of whom died before the Partition of India. He was orphaned during 
                the Partition when his parents, a brother and two sisters were killed 
                in the violence that ensued between the villagers and Muslims who tried 
                to convert them.<br><br>
                To attempt recruitment to the Indian Army, He successfully gained entrance 
                on his fourth attempt, in 1951, and while stationed at the Electrical 
                Mechanical Engineering Centre in Secunderabad and he was introduced 
                to athletics.<br>
                Singh has acknowledged how the army introduced him to sport, saying that 
                "I came from a remote village, I didn't know what running was, or the Olympics".<br><br>
                At the 1962 Asian Games, held in Jakarta, Singh won gold in the 400m and 
                in the 4 x 400m relay.He attended the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, where he 
                was entered to compete in the 400m, the 4 x 100m relay and the 4 x 400m relay. 
                He did not take part in either the 400m or the 4 x 100m relay and the Indian 
                team of Milkha Singh, Makhan Singh, Amrit Pal and Ajmer Singh were eliminated 
                when they finished fourth in the heat stages of the 4 x 400m.<br><br>There have 
                been claims that Singh won 77 of his 80 races,but these are spurious. 
                The number of races in which he participated is not verified, nor is the number 
                of victories, but he lost a 400m race at the 1964 National Games in Calcutta to 
                Makhan Singh and he did not finish first in any of his four races at the 1960 
                Olympic Games or the aforementioned qualification races at the 1956 Olympics<br><br>
                Singh's time in the 1960 Olympics 400m final, which was run on a cinder track, 
                set a national record that stood until 1998 when Paramjit Singh exceeded it on a 
                synthetic track and with fully automatic timing that recorded 45.70 seconds. 
                Although Singh's Olympic result of 45.6 seconds had been hand-timed, 
                an electronic system at those Games had determined his record to be 45.73.
